      <h4>Quick Rundown</h4>
    <p>
I'm a 17 year-old student at Lancaster High school. My long term goal is to be an entrepreneur, my own source of finance. Until that time I plan on continuing my education and gaining experience. The purpose of this website is to host my projects in a quasi-public environment.
